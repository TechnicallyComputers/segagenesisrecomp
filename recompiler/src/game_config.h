/*
 * Widescreen (16:9) injection site — a single instruction in the ORIGINAL
 * (unmodified) ROM whose generated C the recompiler widens by a runtime margin
 * (`g_ws_margin`, extra pixels per side; 0 => byte-identical 4:3). This is the
 * post-patch widening layer: the disasm is NEVER edited, the ROM is recompiled
 * as-is, and the widening lives entirely in the emitted C. Mirrors the
 * snesrecomp/psxrecomp model (recompile original binary, widen on top).
 *
 *   WS_SITE_MASK10 : widen an `andi #imm` immediate one bit (e.g. $1FF -> $3FF)
 *                    so a 9-bit sprite-X clips past 512 instead of wrapping.
 *   WS_SITE_ADDREG : emit  D[reg] += (g_ws_margin >> shift)  BEFORE the insn
 *                    (right/upper bound; row-block count uses shift=3 = /8).
 *   WS_SITE_SUBREG : emit  D[reg] -= (g_ws_margin >> shift)  BEFORE the insn
 *                    (left/lower bound, tile-load start, leading-edge column).
 *   WS_SITE_CULL_LEFT : at a `bmi` site, REPLACE the flag-based condition with
 *                    (int16_t)D[reg] < -(int16_t)(g_ws_margin>>shift) so a left-edge
 *                    cull triggers margin px further out. D[reg] still holds the value
 *                    the bmi's flags reflect (set by the preceding add/sub), so at
 *                    margin 0 it's byte-identical. NON-MUTATING (unlike add/subreg) —
 *                    a right-edge cmpi sharing the same register still sees the
 *                    unmodified value. Only valid on a `bmi` (Bcc cond MI); otherwise
 *                    ignored with a diagnostic.
 *   WS_SITE_ADDIMM / WS_SITE_SUBIMM : widen the IMMEDIATE that a `moveq #imm,Dn` or
 *                    `move.w #imm,Dn` writes, by +/-(g_ws_margin>>shift), at the
 *                    instruction's own address. Used for tile-load column seeds
 *                    (moveq #-16,d5 -> subimm; move.w #320,d5 -> addimm) and the
 *                    full-screen row-block count (moveq #21,d6 -> addimm shift=3).
 *                    In-place (no next-instruction guesswork) and only touches the
 *                    one entry, so it won't over-widen a shared callee. reg is the
 *                    destination Dn. margin 0 => identical.
 *   WS_SITE_CALL_WIDEN : at a `bsr/jsr` site, preset  D[reg] = base + (g_ws_margin>>shift)
 *                    and RETARGET the call to `target` instead of the original callee.
 *                    For row-count widening where the real callee resets the count
 *                    (e.g. S2 DrawBlockRow `moveq #21,d6` @ DF92): retarget the chosen
 *                    callers to a sibling entry (DrawBlockRow_CustomWidth @ DF8A) that
 *                    skips the reset and uses the preset count — so ONLY those callers
 *                    widen, not every caller of the shared callee. `base` = the count
 *                    the callee would have set (e.g. 21). margin 0 => target still gets
 *                    base, identical. The original ret-address push/pop is unchanged.
 *   WS_SITE_CULL_WINDOW_LEFT : at a `bhi` (unsigned-higher) left-window clamp, MUTATE
 *                    D[reg] -= (g_ws_margin>>shift) (word, extends the left edge) and
 *                    REPLACE the branch with a SIGNED `(int16_t)D[reg] > 0` test. The
 *                    mutate destroys the borrow the original `bhi` relied on, so the
 *                    signed `bgt` is the correct equivalent (matches the disasm's
 *                    bhi->bgt). margin 0 => D[reg] unchanged and bgt == bhi here
 *                    (the clamp path is taken for D[reg] <= 0 either way). Only valid
 *                    on a `bhi` (Bcc cond HI); otherwise ignored with a diagnostic.
 *                    Used for the RingsManager visible-window left edge.
 *   WS_SITE_ADDMEM : at a word-size `cmp.w (An),Dn` / `move.w (An),Dn` (or
 *                    their abs.W-source forms, e.g. the player level-bound's
 *                    `move.w (Camera_Min_X_pos).w,d0`), widen
 *                    the VALUE READ FROM MEMORY by +(g_ws_margin>>shift) before
 *                    it is compared/stored. If `base` != 0, cap the widened
 *                    value at the word `base` bytes after the source operand,
 *                    and never go below the original value. Built for the
 *                    camera left-bound clamp ((a2) = Camera_Min_X_pos with
 *                    Camera_Max_X_pos at +2, base=2): the camera then stops
 *                    `margin` px inside the level's left boundary, so the
 *                    widened window never reveals space beyond the level; at a
 *                    boss lock (Min == Max) the cap degrades it to authentic
 *                    behavior instead of overshooting. Apply the SAME site to
 *                    the paired clamp `move` so it stores the value the `cmp`
 *                    compared. Other src modes/sizes are ignored with a
 *                    diagnostic. margin 0 => identical.
 * `scale` (default 1) multiplies the margin for addreg/subreg — e.g. scale=2 adds
 * 2*(margin>>shift), used where a single site must widen by both margins (the ring
 * window's right edge, which also undoes the left edge's -margin).
 * `gate` (addmem only, optional): RAM byte address; the widening applies only
 * while that byte reads 0. Built for the player left level-bound: gated on the
 * game's boss-active flag so boss arenas keep their authentic playfield (the
 * game's own right-bound check consults the same flag). 0 = ungated.
 * reg indexes a data register (0..7); A-registers are out of scope (the
 * widened bounds are all computed in D-registers in these games).
